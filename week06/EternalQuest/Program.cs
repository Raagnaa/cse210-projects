//I make a Due Date to the goals beacuse i learn in the mission that a goal without a Date is not going to happen, first i thought in bonus poitns for the goals, but it didn't turn out very well for me, and neither did the due date thing, but it's what can be done and work.

public class Program

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        GoalManager manager = new GoalManager();
        manager.Start();
